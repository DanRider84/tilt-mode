## ðŸŽ¨ Design Choices

### Typography

- Google Fonts were used to give the site a bold and professional feel that matches the band's energy.

#### Nav Bar and Headings
<p> The font family chosen for the headings, buttons and nav-bar links is <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Luckiest+Guy" title="Luckiest-Guy" rel="nofollow">Luckiest Guy</a>. 
It is a bold, sans-serif display font with a playful and retro style. Its exaggerated letterforms and strong personality make it perfect for grabbing the user's attention.</p>

#### Body-Text
<p> The font family chosen for the body text is <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter" title="Lato" rel="nofollow">Lato</a>. It is also a sans-serif font with a rounded appearance and a modern feel. Lato also has a clean and easy-to-read style, making it suitable for both print and web design.</p>

### Colour Scheme

- The color scheme chosen is based on the band's logo shown in the header.
- The header and footer will have a black (#00000) background to suit the rock theme of the band along with beige (#F5f5DC) for contrast.
- Other colors in the palette will be used throughout the body sections of the website to capture the fun/party theme represented by those colors, also in contrast of the black

### Images

- Sample imagery includes band members (on homepage) and event performances in a dedicated gallery section. Images are displayed in grid form with responsiveness across devices.
- There are two band logos used in the design - the first is in color and used in the header section, the second is in grey/white and used as a background image which will move vertically across when the user scrolls up and down the page.

### Responsiveness

- Bootstrapâ€™s grid system ensures the site is fully responsive across all devices and screen sizes.
