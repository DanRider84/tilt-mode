## ðŸŽ¨ Design Choices

### Typography

- Google Fonts were used to give the site a bold and professional feel that matches the band's energy.

#### Nav Bar and Headings
<p> The font family chosen for the headings, buttons and nav-bar links is <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Luckiest+Guy" title="Luckiest-Guy" rel="nofollow">Luckiest Guy</a>. 
It is a bold, sans-serif display font with a playful and retro style. Its exaggerated letterforms and strong personality make it perfect for grabbing the user's attention.</p>

#### Body-Text
<p> The font family chosen for the body text is <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter" title="Lato" rel="nofollow">Lato</a>. It is also a sans-serif font with a rounded appearance and a modern feel. Lato also has a clean and easy-to-read style, making it suitable for both print and web design.</p>

### Colour Scheme

- The color scheme chosen is based on the band's logo shown in the header.
- The header and footer will have a black (#00000) background to suit the rock theme of the band.
- Other colors in the palette will be used throughout the website to capture the 90s retro fun/party theme represented by those colors, also in contrast of the black.

### Images

- Sample imagery includes a picture of the whole band along with individual band member photos  displayed in grid form with responsiveness across devices.
- The band logo is used as a hero image and the navigation bar contains a separate image which consitsts of an extract of text from the bands logo showing the band's name.
- All images/graphic provided by the band have been obtained directly from Tilt Mode and used with their permission.

### Responsiveness
- Bootstrapâ€™s grid system ensures the site is fully responsive across all devices and screen sizes. A mobile first approach was taken, with adjustments necessary for medium, large and extra-large devices.
- Media query used for mobile screens to ensure each page sections appears below the collapsable navbar when selected.
- The breakpoints I am using are from Bootstrap (Medium: =>768px Large: =>992px Extra large: =>1200px).

## Features
Layout is easy to use and adheres to the best practices in formatting and styling. Users can easily navigate between sections and have quick and easy access to the contact/booking section to book or raise a query with the band.
### Existing Features

#### Navbar
The navbar was created using Bootstrap classes. It contains:
- the band's name using graphics from the band's logo to spell out 'Tilt Mode' of left of navbar, which also navigates back to the home section when clicked on.
- headings/links to each section as well as a CTA booking button (link to the booking form) on the right of navbar.
At mobile screen size, a toggler appears on the right of the navbar and the collapsable menu containing the section links appears on the left of the sceen. The nooking button and navbar links have a separate contrast of colours when hovered over/selected. 

#### Header
- Contains the band's logo as a hero image, followed by a band bio.
