## ðŸŽ¨ Design Choices

### Typography

- Google Fonts were used to give the site a bold and professional feel that matches the band's energy.

#### Nav Bar and Headings
<p> The font family chosen for the headings, buttons and nav-bar links is <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Luckiest+Guy" title="Luckiest-Guy" rel="nofollow">Luckiest Guy</a>. 
It is a bold, sans-serif display font with a playful and retro style. Its exaggerated letterforms and strong personality make it perfect for grabbing the user's attention.</p>

#### Body-Text
<p> The font family chosen for the body text is <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter" title="Lato" rel="nofollow">Lato</a>. It is also a sans-serif font with a rounded appearance and a modern feel. Lato also has a clean and easy-to-read style, making it suitable for both print and web design.</p>

### Colour Scheme

- The color scheme chosen is based on the band's logo shown in the header.
- The header and footer will have a black (#00000) background to suit the rock theme of the band.
- Other colors in the palette will be used throughout the website to capture the 90s retro fun/party theme represented by those colors, also in contrast of the black.

### Images

- The band logo is used as a hero image and the navigation bar contains a separate image which consitsts of an extract of text from the bands logo showing the band's name.
